Can order any drink when you get a coupon. Program takes (what I initially thought) was raw input and prints it to screen. So code probably looked like this:

	scanf("What would you like to order \n %s", drink);
	printf("%s\n", drink);

Buffer overflow (seemingly) wasn't possible, so format string was next likely, which worked.
