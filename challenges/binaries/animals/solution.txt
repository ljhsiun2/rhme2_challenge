Binary takes user input and only users first char to determine if "cat", "dog", or "mouse". If you throw enough chars in (e.g. caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa) it crashes. Indicates buffer overflow.

You can also notice weird characters show up at certain inputs, e.g. "c"*11 causes extra bytes to show up. Looked like addresses/pointers to where the ascii art is. Just overwrite them, and you gucci
